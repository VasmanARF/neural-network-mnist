# Simple Neural Network for MNIST Classification

This repository contains a simple implementation of a neural network built from scratch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The network is designed using NumPy and includes functionality for training, accuracy evaluation, and interactive testing.

## Characteristics

- A fully connected neural network with one hidden layer.
- Uses the MNIST dataset for training and testing.
- Includes forward propagation and backpropagation steps for training.
- Adjustable hyperparameters like learning rate and the number of epochs.
- Interactive mode for predicting individual digits from the dataset.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VasmanARF/neural-network-mnist
    cd neural-network-mnist
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

3. Download and add the MNIST dataset (`mnist.npz`) into the `DataSet` folder of this repository. If you don't have the file, you can download it from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/img-datasets/mnist.npz).

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. Run the Python script to train the neural network on the MNIST dataset:

    ```bash
    python neuralNetwork.py
    ```

2. The model will train for the specified number of epochs, and after each epoch, it will print the current accuracy of the model.

### Testing the Model

After training, you can use the interactive mode to predict individual digits from the dataset. 
1. When prompted, enter the index of an image (from 0 to 59999) for the model to predict:

    ```bash
    Enter an index from the dataSet to predict, 0-59999: 
    ```

2. The program will display the image and its predicted digit.

## Customization

You can easily customize the neural network by modifying the following parameters:

- **Learning Rate**: Change the `learn_rate` variable to adjust how fast the model learns.
- **Number of Epochs**: Modify the `epochs` variable to set the number of training iterations.
- **Hidden Layer Size**: Adjust the size of the hidden layer by changing the dimensions of `weights_input_hidden` and `bias_hidden`.

Example in `neuralNetwork.py`:

```python
# Hyperparameters
learn_rate = 0.01  # Learning rate
epochs = 5  # Number of epochs
